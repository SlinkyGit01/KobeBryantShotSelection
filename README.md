# KobeBryantShotSelection Competition

# Kobe Bryant marked his retirement from the NBA by scoring 60 points in his final game as a Los Angeles Laker on Wednesday, April 12, 2016. Drafted into the NBA at the age of 17, Kobe earned the sportâ€™s highest accolades throughout his long career.

# Using 20 years of data on Kobe's swishes and misses, I predicted which shots will find the bottom of the net. 
# I used this competition to practice classification basics, feature engineering, and time series analysis.
